            This is a section in which you will study most of the programming languages ​​​​in the computer, and its 
            materials differ from university to university, but in general, the materials in short teach you 
            how to translate program languages ​​and how to study software infrastructure, and you also take 
            excerpts about programming networks and websites, but your studies in this section focus on 
            programming Computing, this is the most popular department in the world, not only in Egyptian universities

                  Bioinformatics, as related to genetics and genomics, is a scientific subdiscipline that involves
                  usingcomputer technology to collect, store, analyze and disseminate biological data and information,
                  such as DNA and amino acid sequences or annotations about those sequences. Scientists and clinicians
                  use databases that organize and index such biological information to increase our understanding of
                  health and disease and,in certain cases, as part of medical care.
